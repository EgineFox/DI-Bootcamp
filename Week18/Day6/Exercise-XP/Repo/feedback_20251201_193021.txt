suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a React component for rendering a single todo item and dispatching actions. To fully address the exercise, you would need to provide the other components (TodoList, AddTodo), actions, and reducers.
- Consider adding propTypes to the component for better type checking and documentation.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet only shows the TodoList component, which is just a part of the complete todo application. To fully address the exercise, you need to show the implementation of actions, reducers, store setup, the component for adding todos, and how the components are connected to the Redux store using `connect` or `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks.
- For completeness, it would be helpful to include the action creators, reducer logic, and store configuration.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust method for generating unique IDs, especially in a production environment, rather than relying solely on `Date.now()`.
- Ensure that actions are handled efficiently, especially as the todo list grows in size. While the current implementation is suitable for small lists, consider optimization techniques for larger datasets.
