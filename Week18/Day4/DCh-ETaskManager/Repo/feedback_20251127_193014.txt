suggestions for improvement:
- While this component correctly implements task filtering, it only addresses one part of the instructions. It lacks the task editing functionality.
- Consider adding the `EDIT_TASK` action to the reducer (which is only alluded to, not shown in the code snippet).
- Show how useRef is used to manage the editing state and update task text in the Task component itself.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a filter component outside the task item for filtering tasks to follow instructions more closely.
- The instructions mention filtering tasks by completion status. Ensure you have a mechanism in place to trigger and handle the filter action in the reducer and component.
