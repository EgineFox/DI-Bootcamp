suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `find_oldest_cat` function could be made more flexible to handle any number of cats, not just three.
- In Exercise 2, the `__lt__`, `__eq__`, and `__gt__` methods in the `Dog` class are not directly related to the chapter content (methods and attributes) but are good additions. Consider adding a docstring to the `Dog` class and its methods to improve readability.
- In Exercise 3, the `Song` class's constructor could be simplified to handle string input more elegantly by directly splitting the string rather than relying on an if/else block.
- In Exercise 4, consider using a more descriptive variable name for `animal_groups` within the `Zoo` class, such as `animal_groupings` or `animal_groups_by_letter`.
