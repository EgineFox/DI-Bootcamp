suggestions for improvement:
- In the line `console.log(genericAnimal.makeSound);`, you are logging the function itself rather than calling the function. Change it to `console.log(genericAnimal.makeSound());` to execute the function and log its return value.
- Consider adding types explicitly in more places for better readability and maintainability.
