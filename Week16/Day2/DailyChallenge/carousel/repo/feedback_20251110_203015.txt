suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more descriptive component name than 'DemoCarousel'. A name like 'CityCarousel' would better reflect its purpose.
- For better reusability, consider making the image URLs and legends props that can be passed into the component.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet is only CSS, which is not sufficient to build the React carousel as required by the instructions.
- The code should include a React component that uses the `react-responsive-carousel` package to display the images in a carousel format.
- The component should import the necessary dependencies, fetch or declare the image URLs, and render the carousel with the images.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a basic React setup, but it doesn't implement the carousel functionality as described in the problem statement. The `App` component's content is unknown, so I'm assuming it does not include the React Responsive Carousel.
- To address the problem, you need to install the `react-responsive-carousel` package using npm or yarn, import it into your `App` component, and use it to display the images provided in the instructions.
- The provided images should be used as the images within the carousel component.
