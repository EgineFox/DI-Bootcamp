suggestions for improvement:
- The class name `Desk` should be `Deck`. This is a minor typographical error but it impacts readability and understanding.
- The `show` method in the `Deck` class iterates through the `cards` list and calls the `show` method of each `Card` object.  This is correct but could be improved for clarity. Consider adding a print statement to indicate which card is being shown.
- Add error handling for the case where the deck is empty when calling `deal()`. Currently, `pop()` will throw an exception.
Correctness: 80%
