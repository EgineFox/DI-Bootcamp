- Skipping file (too many comments or blank lines).

suggestions for improvement:
- The instructions specify creating two separate files, `anagram_checker.py` and `anagrams.py`. The provided code combines both functionalities into a single file.
- The program lacks user interface elements as described in the instructions (menu, user input handling, error messages, formatted output).
- The `get_anagrams` function could be made more efficient by using a more optimized algorithm for finding anagrams.
- Error handling should be improved; instead of printing error messages within the `AnagramChecker` class, exceptions should be raised and handled in the `anagrams.py` file for better separation of concerns.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagram_checker.py` file is missing, making it impossible to fully assess the correctness of the `AnagramChecker` class.  The provided code assumes its existence and correct functionality.
- Error handling could be improved. Instead of just printing 'Error' messages, consider using exceptions for more robust error management. This would allow for more graceful handling of unexpected situations.
- The performance could be improved by optimizing the `get_anagrams` method in the `AnagramChecker` class.  Currently, the efficiency isn't clear without seeing its implementation.
- Consider adding a progress indicator for large word lists to enhance user experience.
