suggestions for improvement:
- Consider moving the addTodo dispatch logic into a separate function for better readability.
- While the id generation is simple, using a more robust UUID generator might be preferable for larger applications.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided App.js file only imports and renders a `TODO` component. It doesn't include any of the Redux Toolkit slice creation, store configuration, component implementation (TodoList, AddTodo, TodoItem), or Redux connection (using useSelector and useDispatch) as outlined in Exercise 1.
- To address Exercise 1, the `TODO` component needs to be connected to a Redux store that manages todo items.
- The submission lacks code related to creating a Redux Toolkit slice, configuring the Redux store, and implementing the individual React components with Redux hooks.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet sets up the React application and connects it to the Redux store using the Provider component. While it's a necessary part of the setup, it doesn't implement any of the specific functionality described in the exercise, such as creating the todo slice, reducers, or React components for adding, toggling, and removing todos.
- The code is missing the core logic for managing todos as outlined in the exercise instructions. The slice with reducers, the TodoList, AddTodo, and TodoItem components are all missing

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using Immer's built-in methods for more concise state updates (though the current approach is perfectly valid).
- Add type definitions for state and actions.
