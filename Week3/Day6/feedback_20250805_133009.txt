suggestions for improvement:
- In `get_random_sentence`, handle the case where the word list might be empty more robustly.  Returning a message is fine, but consider raising an exception or using a default word list instead for better error management. 
- Improve input validation in the main function. While it checks for integer type and range, it doesn't handle non-numeric input gracefully. Consider using a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until a valid integer within the range is provided.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each section in the JSON exercise.
- The file path in Exercise 1 is hardcoded. It's better to make it configurable, either through a command-line argument or a configuration file.
