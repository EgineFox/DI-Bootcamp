suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only imports and renders a `Calculator` component. It does not implement the core logic of the calculator as described in the problem statement (taking two numbers as input, performing an operation, and displaying the result).
- The actual calculator logic and component implementation are missing, making the submission incomplete and failing to address the requirements outlined in the 'What you will create' and 'Instructions' sections.
