suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only sets up the Express app and mounts the tasksRoutes. It doesn't include the implementation of the routes themselves (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), or the JSON file interaction, which are key parts of the problem description.
- Consider adding error handling to the main app setup (e.g., for JSON parsing errors).
- Include the implementation of the task routes in `tasksRoutes.js` using `express.Router()` and implement the logic for reading and writing to the JSON file.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust ID generation strategy (e.g., UUID) instead of `Date.now()` to avoid potential collisions, especially in high-volume scenarios.
- Implement more comprehensive validation for the `updateTask` route. Specifically, validate the 'completed' field to ensure it's a boolean if provided.
- Implement logging for debugging and auditing purposes.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a JSON file, not an Express.js application with the specified API routes. It does not address the instructions to create an Express.js application, implement routes, or handle file operations.
- The provided content is only a JSON file and does not include any code or instructions on how the JSON file is used within an Express.js application. Therefore it doesn't fulfill any of the requirements.
- The content doesn't use express.Router, implement validation or implement error handling as requested in the instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code defines the routes as requested in the prompt, which is a good starting point.
- However, the prompt also specifies creating a JSON file to store task data, implementing validation for task creation/updates, and implementing error handling. These features are not implemented in this file and are likely deferred to the controller functions. The submission should include a more complete example to be fully correct.
- Consider adding try-catch blocks in the controller functions to handle potential errors during file operations (read/write).
- Implement input validation (e.g., using a library like 'express-validator') to ensure that the request body contains the necessary fields and that they conform to the expected data types. This should happen in the controller functions.
